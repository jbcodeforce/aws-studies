# Lambda

AWS Lambda, you can run code without provisioning or managing servers or containers.

Upload your source code, and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability.

A  Lambda function has three primary components â€“ trigger, code, and configuration.

* Triggers describe when a Lambda function should run. A trigger integrates your Lambda function with other AWS services, enabling you to run your Lambda function in response to certain API calls that occur in your AWS account.
* Configuration includes compute resources, execution timeout, IAM roles (lambda_basic_execution)...
* Code: Java, Node.js, C#, Go, or Python

you pay only for what you use it. 

AWS Lambda automatically monitors Lambda functions and reports metrics through Amazon CloudWatch. To help you monitor your code as it executes, Lambda automatically tracks the number of requests, the latency per request, and the number of requests resulting in an error and publishes the associated metrics.  You can leverage these metrics to set custom alarms.
